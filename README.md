CryptoCompare API Key
Note:

CryptoCompare works without an API key but the limits will slowly be reduced over time and you may be blocked from fetching.

In order to get the best experience, please create a free API key here:

https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/pricing

Then, in your app:

const cc = require('cryptocompare')

cc.setApiKey('<your-api-key>')
